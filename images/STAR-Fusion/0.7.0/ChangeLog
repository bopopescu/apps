Version 0.7.0 (Mar 5, 2016)
	Update to FusionFilter v0.1.0
	Require long double anchor support for those fusions only supported by breakpoint/split reads and no spanning fragments, reduces FP rate.

Version 0.6.0 (Dec 16, 2015)
	including FFPM calculations in output summary.

Version 0.5.4 (Nov, 10, 2015)
	update to FusionFilter, no 2-pass in genome-generate function

Version 0.5.3 (Nov, 6, 2015)
	removed duplicate PE alignments supporting fusions, decreases FP rate dramatically on samples w/ high PCR dups, w/ little effect on other 'good' samples w/ low DUP rate.

Version 0.5.2 (Oct 26, 2016)
	Bugfix for paired cigar-string alignment parsing leading to proper grouping of junction counts.

Version 0.5.1 (Oct 10, 2015)
     added back capability to run STAR-Fusion from an existing Chimeric.out.junctions file from an earlier STAR run.
     Use parameter:  --chimeric_junction|J or (--left_fq, --right_fq)
